- Familiarity with terminal and basic Linux commands.

#### 1. System Update and Preparation

- It’s essential to start with an updated system for security and compatibility:
  ```bash
  sudo yum update -y
  ```
- This command updates the package database and upgrades installed packages.

#### 2. Installing Required Dependencies

- On RHEL, certain dependencies might be needed for WireGuard installation. First, install the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install epel-release -y
  ```
- Then install Curl, a tool used for downloading files from the internet:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install curl -y
  ```

#### 3. Downloading the WireGuard Manager Script

- The WireGuard Manager script automates the process of installing and configuring WireGuard:
  ```bash
  curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/complexorganizations/wireguard-manager/main/wireguard-manager.sh -o /usr/local/bin/wireguard-manager.sh
  ```
- This command fetches the script and places it in a standard executable path.

#### 4. Executing the Installation Script

- Modify the script permissions to make it executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wireguard-manager.sh
  ```
- Launch the installation script:
  ```bash
  sudo bash /usr/local/bin/wireguard-manager.sh
  ```
- The script will guide you through the installation steps, including server setup and initial client configuration.

#### 5. Customizing and Managing WireGuard VPN

- Use the script for any post-installation adjustments or client management:
  ```bash
  sudo bash /usr/local/bin/wireguard-manager.sh
  ```
- This includes adding new clients, removing clients, and tweaking server settings.

#### 6. Testing VPN Setup

- After installation and configuration, test the VPN to ensure it’s working correctly:
  - Connect using the client configuration files.
  - Check the WireGuard interface status and connections:
    ```bash
    sudo wg show
    ```

#### 7. Regular Updates and Security Practices
