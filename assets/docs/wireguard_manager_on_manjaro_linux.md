### WireGuard Manager Installation Guide for Manjaro Linux

#### Prerequisites

- A system running Manjaro Linux.
- Sudo privileges.
- An active internet connection.
- Familiarity with the Linux command line and package management.

#### 1. System Update and Upgrade

- Keeping your Manjaro system up-to-date is important for security and compatibility:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -Syu
  ```
- This command updates your package database and upgrades all installed packages.

#### 2. Installing Necessary Dependencies

- Manjaro, based on Arch Linux, uses the `pacman` package manager. Install Curl and other dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S curl bash
  ```
- Curl is essential for downloading scripts from the internet, and Bash is required to execute the script.

#### 3. Downloading the WireGuard Manager Script

- The WireGuard Manager script simplifies the installation and configuration of WireGuard:
  ```bash
  curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/complexorganizations/wireguard-manager/main/wireguard-manager.sh -o /usr/local/bin/wireguard-manager.sh
  ```
- This command downloads the script to a standard executable path.

#### 4. Running the Installation Script

- Before executing the script, change its permissions to ensure it's executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wireguard-manager.sh
  ```
- Start the WireGuard installation process:
  ```bash
  sudo bash /usr/local/bin/wireguard-manager.sh
  ```
- The script guides you through the installation, including setting up the WireGuard server and clients.

#### 5. Configuring WireGuard VPN

- Post-installation, use the script for any configuration changes or to manage clients:
  ```bash
  sudo bash /usr/local/bin/wireguard-manager.sh
  ```
- This command provides options for adding clients, removing clients, or altering server settings.

#### 6. Testing and Verifying VPN Functionality

- Test the VPN functionality with the configurations provided for client devices:
  - Connect using the WireGuard client and the provided configuration.
  - Verify the status of the WireGuard interface:
    ```bash
    sudo wg show
    ```
- These steps help ensure that WireGuard is correctly set up and functioning.

#### 7. Ongoing Maintenance and Security

- Regular updates and security checks are crucial for maintaining a reliable VPN service:
  - Update Manjaro and WireGuard periodically:
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Syu
    ```
  - Review and update WireGuard configurations regularly.
