# Comparison of Personal VPN Deployment: Cloud-Hosted vs. Self-Hosted on Raspberry Pi

## Abstract

This paper compares two popular methods for setting up a personal VPN: deploying on a cloud platform versus self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi. It evaluates costs, maintenance, performance, scalability, and environmental impact over a 10-year period, offering insights for both novice and experienced users. The goal is to guide users toward a VPN solution tailored to their needs and technical expertise.

## Introduction

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is essential for ensuring privacy, bypassing geographic restrictions, and securing internet communications. Setting up a personal VPN can be approached in two primary ways:

1. **Cloud-Hosted VPN**: Using cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
2. **Self-Hosted VPN**: Deploying a VPN server on a local device, such as a Raspberry Pi.

This comparison analyzes these approaches in depth, breaking down costs, operational considerations, and user requirements over a 10-year period.

| **Security Features**    | Advanced: Built-in DDoS protection, monitoring tools   | Comparable: Home routers often include robust firewalls |
| **Ease of Setup**        | Moderate: Requires knowledge of cloud configuration    | Simple: Raspberry Pi setup guides widely available      |
| **Monthly Cost**         | $5–$10                                                 | ~$1.50                                                  |
| **10-Year Cost**         | ~$600–$1,200/year × 10 = $6,000–$12,000                | ~$60 (Pi) + ($1.50 × 12 × 10) = ~$240                   |

## Detailed Monthly Breakdown (10 Years)

### Cloud VPN:

- **Year 1**: $5–$10/month × 12 = $60–$120
- **Year 2**: $5–$10/month × 12 = $60–$120
- **Year 3**: $5–$10/month × 12 = $60–$120
- ... (repeated for 10 years)
- **Total Cloud Cost**: $600–$1,200/year × 10 = $6,000–$12,000

### Raspberry Pi VPN:

- **Year 1**: $60 (hardware) + ($1.50 × 12) = $78
- **Year 2**: $1.50/month × 12 = $18
- **Year 3–10**: $18/year
- **Total Pi Cost**: $60 + ($18 × 9) = $240

## Explanation of Costs

### Cloud VPN

1. **Initial Setup Cost**: Free for most cloud providers, requiring only account setup.
2. **Subscription Fees**: ~$5–$10/month for a virtual private server.
3. **Electricity Costs**: Covered by the provider.
4. **Maintenance**: Minimal; providers handle updates and patches.
5. **Security**: Cloud solutions offer built-in features like DDoS protection and advanced monitoring. While these features are an added advantage, modern home routers also provide robust firewalls and basic security protections comparable to those used in personal deployments.

### Raspberry Pi VPN

1. **Initial Setup Cost**: ~$60 for a Raspberry Pi, case, power supply, and microSD card.
2. **Electricity Costs**: ~$1.50/month, dependent on local rates.
3. **Maintenance**: Periodic manual updates and backups required.
4. **Security**: Home routers generally include effective firewalls, and the security of a Raspberry Pi VPN depends on proper configuration of encryption and authentication protocols.

## Additional Considerations

1. **Learning Curve**:

   - Cloud VPN: Requires knowledge of cloud platforms and network configuration.
   - Raspberry Pi VPN: Basic familiarity with Linux and networking.

2. **Use Case Scenarios**:

   - **Cloud VPN**: Best for businesses or users requiring high performance and uptime.
   - **Raspberry Pi VPN**: Ideal for personal use, small-scale needs, or cost-sensitive users.

3. **Environmental Impact**:

   - Cloud VPNs rely on large data centers with high energy consumption.
   - Raspberry Pi is energy-efficient, consuming only 15W on average.

4. **Scalability**:

   - Cloud solutions offer elastic resources for growing demands.
   - Raspberry Pi is hardware-constrained and suited for fixed requirements.

5. **Backup and Failover**:
   - Cloud VPNs include redundancy by design.
   - Raspberry Pi requires manual backups and lacks automatic failover.

## Final Recommendations

- **Choose Cloud VPN**: For reliability, scalability, and minimal hands-on management. Suitable for businesses or users valuing high uptime.
- **Choose Raspberry Pi VPN**: For cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency, and personal projects. Suitable for tech enthusiasts willing to manage their setup.

## Conclusion

This comparison highlights the trade-offs between a cloud-hosted and self-hosted VPN. While the cloud offers unparalleled scalability and simplicity, the Raspberry Pi provides an affordable and eco-friendly alternative for those with modest needs. Additionally, the security offered by home routers ensures that a self-hosted solution can be comparable in protection when configured correctly. By evaluating your budget, technical expertise, and use case, you can select the most appropriate VPN solution.
