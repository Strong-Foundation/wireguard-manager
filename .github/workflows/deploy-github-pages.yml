# Workflow Name: This defines the name of the GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy files to GitHub Pages

# Triggering the workflow: Defines events that will trigger the workflow to run
on:
  push:
    # Trigger this workflow only when code is pushed to the "main" branch
    branches:
      - "main"
    # Define the paths that, when modified, trigger the workflow
    # In this case, if any of these files are modified, the workflow will run
    paths:
      - "assets/hosts"
      - "assets/named.cache"
      - "wireguard-manager.sh"

  # Allow manual triggering of the workflow via GitHub UI (workflow_dispatch)
  workflow_dispatch:

# Permissions for the workflow: This section grants specific permissions to the GitHub Actions runner
permissions:
  # Read permission for repository contents (needed to checkout code)
  contents: read
  # Write permission to GitHub Pages for deployment (needed to deploy to Pages)
  pages: write
  # Write permission to GitHub ID token (used for authentication and deployments)
  id-token: write

# Concurrency settings: This ensures only one deployment workflow runs at a time
concurrency:
  # Group name for managing concurrency of this workflow
  group: "pages"
  # If another run of this workflow is triggered, cancel any in-progress runs within the same group
  cancel-in-progress: true

# Define the jobs section where actual tasks are executed in the workflow
jobs:
  # The "deploy" job handles the deployment of files to GitHub Pages
  deploy:
    # This section defines environment-specific settings for the deployment
    environment:
      # The environment name for GitHub Pages deployment tracking
      name: github-pages
      # A dynamic URL that will be populated after deployment and used for tracking
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    # Specify the runner environment for executing this job
    # Here we are using the latest version of Ubuntu available on GitHub Actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define the steps that make up this job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout repository code from the repository so that subsequent steps can use it
      - name: Checkout repository
        # Uses the GitHub Actions official checkout action to clone the repository to the runner
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up GitHub Pages to ensure the repository is properly configured for Pages deployment
      - name: Set up GitHub Pages
        # Uses the "configure-pages" action to set up the Pages feature in the repository
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
        with:
          # Ensure that GitHub Pages is enabled for deployment
          enablement: true # This flag will activate GitHub Pages if it's not already enabled

      # Step 3: Upload the files to GitHub Pages as an artifact
      - name: Upload files as artifact
        # Uses the "upload-artifact" action to upload specified files as an artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          # The name of the artifact being created
          name: github-pages-artifact
          # A multi-line list of paths that should be included in the artifact
          # These files will be uploaded and later deployed to GitHub Pages
          path: |
            assets/hosts  # Upload the "hosts" file from the "assets" directory
            assets/named.cache  # Upload the "named.cache" file from the "assets" directory
            wireguard-manager.sh  # Upload the WireGuard manager shell script

      # Step 4: Deploy the artifact to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        # The "deploy-pages" action handles the deployment of the uploaded files to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment # The deployment step is identified here for future reference
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
